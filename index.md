# Preliminary Exam Repository

The preliminary exam is a first-year evaluation for students in the Program in Applied & Computational Mathematics (PACM) at Princeton University. This repository of past exam questions and transcripts is designed to be a helpful resource for new students. This webpage is an analog of this [similar initiative](https://web.math.princeton.edu/generals/) from students in pure maths.
